# Sports-Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes sports performance data to discover patterns, trends, and relationships that help understand athletesâ€™ performance under various conditions. It combines traditional metrics with environmental factors for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Data Sources
- Official sports statistics (e.g., NPB or MLB)
- Weather data (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
- Publicly available match records

## Analysis Techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Correlation and trend analysis
- Visualization using graphs, histograms, and heatmaps

## Example Analyses
- Batting performance vs. environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, weather)
- Team scoring trends and win-rate relationships
- Individual player performance comparison (batting order, left/right-handedness)

## Objective
To provide insights that support strategic decisions, training plans, and performance evaluation in sports.

## Notes
The project emphasizes both quantitative analysis and creative approaches, combining traditional performance metrics with environmental and situational factors.
